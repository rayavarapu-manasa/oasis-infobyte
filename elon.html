        <h2>A brief summary</h2>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p> 
        Musk was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and a South African father.Musk grew up with
        his head stuck in books and computers. He was bullied by his classmates and often beaten 
        up by class bullies as a little, timid youngster until he grew strong enough to defend 
        himself during a growth spurt in his teens. He developed a video game at the age of 12 
        and sold it to a computer magazine. Musk left South Africa in 1988 after getting a Canadian
        passport because he refused to support apartheid through compulsory military duty and
        wanted to pursue the higher economic prospects offered in the United States.       
        </p>
        <h3>Tesla and SpaceX</h3>
        <p>
            This is where Elon Musk set himself apart from the rest of the world’s wealthiest.
            Musk had for long envisioned that Humans would eventually set up a colony on Mars,
            and that space transportation would be the future. With SpaceX Musk’s objective
            was to establish a space travel system that wouldn’t be prohibitively expensive
            and would make space travel cheap and economical. And thus, Musk founded Space 
            Exploration Technologies Corp or SpaceX. 

            SpaceX attempted to launch its first rocket in 2006, which was a disaster. After two
            more failed attempts, SpaceX’s successful launch was in 2008. SpaceX has been receiving
            contracts from NASA and several other space-oriented startups.
            
            In 2018, SpaceX started launching the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit
            satellites, which provides satellite Internet access. 

            Musk was also involved in Tesla Energy, which was previously known as SolarCity.
            SolarCity was one of the major players in developing and installing solar panels 
            in and around the state of New York. Having funded the company initially, Musk
            acquired SolarCity to develop battery technology that would be capable of powering
            the cars that Tesla made, and eventually entire cities.
        </p> 
        <h3>Investing in openAI</h3>
        <p>
            Musk has been very vocal about the need to regulate or rather steer the development
            of AI in a certain direction that would allow Humans to have perpetual control over 
            Artificial Intelligence. For this, he founded OpenAI, a not for profit artificial
            intelligence research company that would develop systems to counteract large 
            corporations and governments who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence
            systems. In 2018, Musk relinquished his position on the board of OpenAI, in order to 
            avoid conflict of interests, as Tesla too, had started dabbling with AI, for its
            Autopilot or self-driving systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Neuralink</h3>
        <p>
            In 2016, Musk co-founded a neurotechnology startup called Neuralink, whose objective
            was to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence and come up with 
            embeddable devices that would close the gap between intelligent machines and humans. 
            Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with 
            software more effectively. One of the earliest demonstrations that Neuralink gave, 
            showed a device that could cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities
            albeit with some major limitations. All of Neuralink’s work have been prototypes, most 
            of them still being in the research phase.
        </p>
        <h3>Hyperloop</h3>
        <p>
            While The Boring Company is most famous for its novelty flamethrower which they sold
            in limited numbers. However, The Boring Company constructs underground tunnels. The 
            tunnels they may are made under contracts from various cities, for underground
            transportation, and sewage systems.

            This was in extension to Hyperloop, which he founded in 2013. The objective of
            Hyperloop was to create a transportation system using a vacuum tube train. Although
            there have been no working prototypes of the system or of the pods that would be
            used in the system, Musk has already received contracts from a number of cities in
            the US.

        <h3>Facts of Elon Musk</h3>
        <p>
          *Musk’s earliest venture was the founding of Zip2, a company that provided maps and
           business directories to newspapers and was later sold to Compaq for $307 million.<br><br>  
          *In 2002, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, better known as SpaceX. Musk was
           convinced that humanity's survival depended on its ability to become a multi-planetary 
           species, but current rocket launching technologies were too expensive. This he 
           accomplished with the launch of the Falcon 1 in 2006, the Falcon 9 in 2010 and the
           Falcon Heavy in 2018.<br><br>  
          *Because of the lack of funding, Musk had to invest his own money into the development
           of SpaceX rockets. Currently, the company has a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for
           resupply missions and eventually ferrying people to and from the International Space
           Station.
